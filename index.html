  <h1>Welcome to Complaint portal</h1>
  <br>
  <p class="p"><strong>The place where your complaints are precious </strong></p>
  <h4>Following are the list of problems encountered </h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Lack of government transport</li><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Vehicles increasing pollution: The vehicles that produce high toxic pollutants are still moving on the streets. The government’s claim of frequent monitoring of vehicle emission has not lessened the pollution. The authority has not been
        able
        to effectively implement the decision to ban 20-year old vehicles that was started since last April. Old vehicles have not only increased pollution but also created nuisances to commuters. People are forced to suffer while they travel in old
        vehicles, apart from the risks involved.</li><br>
      <li>Delay: The old vehicles have dominated the public transportation sector. People are compelled to travel by hanging on vehicle doors due to lack of sufficient vehicles. On the other hand, these vehicles do not ferry the passengers to their
        destinations on time. They delay the travel by waiting for passengers at a stop for a longer time and cram the passengers in the bus beyond capacity. However, traffic police have failed to regulate them.</li><br>
      <li>Filth: Many vehicles have not maintained sanitation. The vehicles are dirty and stinking, and with broken and filthy seats. No government authority has monitored it.
        Vehicles reduced during office hour: Flow of passengers is higher during rush hours. However, many public buses are used for carrying school students in the morning and evening. As a result, the vehicles are not sufficiently available for
        passengers. Despite taking permission for specific public transport route, these vehicles are eying more money by offering service to the schools. The concerned authorities are unware of it.
      </li><br>
      <li>Misbehavior and insulting words: The passengers travelling on public vehicles have to face misbehaviors of drivers and helpers and their insulting and disrespectful words such as ‘why did you ride? The passengers standing on the back
        passageway or back seat cannot get out easily at their stop. The vehicles staff squeeze the passengers giving hardly any space to breathe.</li><br>
      <li>Misuse of reservation seats: The reservation seats are allocated for senior citizens, disabled and women in the public transportations. However, the seat reservation rule is not effectively implemented. The vehicle staffers have not been
        cooperative in implementing such rules. Young people unabashedly sit on the seats allocated for senior citizens.</li><br>
      <li>Risk due to unhealthy competition: There is an unhealthy completion among the vehicles operating on the same routes, thus increasing the risks of accidents. They overtake one another to pick more passengers. This tendency has been posing
        threats to other vehicles and motorbikes. </li><br>
      <li>Not reaching to destinations: In many cases, the vehicles do not reach the destinations and mail the passengers to other vehicles. Moreover, patients, elderly and disabled people are forced to bear the brunt because of overcrowded vehicles.

    <li class="problems">Increasing potholes</li>
    <p>When there are bad road conditions, then accidents are more prone to happen. The poor road conditions can further be exasperated by a dangerous combination of seasonal traffic and other traffic conditions that exist. Changes in weather can
      cause hazardous road conditionsRoads are maintained by the city, county, and state and each has its own set of maintenance responsibilities when it comes to roadways. While one group might be responsible for filling potholes, you may find that
      it is another group that paves the road. Here are just a few of the unsafe road conditions that can lead to a car crash:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cracks and potholes that can cause a driver to lose control of the vehicle</li>
      <li>Signs that have fallen or can’t be seen because of overgrown foliage</li>
      <li>Faded paint markings that are invisible from the driver’s seat</li>
      <li>Inadequate guardrails on curves and overpasses</li>
      <li>Lack of rumble strips on freeways</li>
      <li>Poor traffic control in construction zones</li>
      <li>Placing construction materials and utility poles in a way that obstructs a driver’s vision</li>

    <br>
    <li class="problems">Water quality</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Contaminated water and poor sanitation are linked to transmission of diseases such as cholera, diarrhoea, dysentery, hepatitis A, typhoid and polio. Absent, inadequate, or inappropriately managed water and sanitation services expose
        individuals to preventable health risks. This is particularly the case in health care facilities where both patients and staff are placed at additional risk of infection and disease when water, sanitation and hygiene services are lacking. With
        children particularly at risk from water-related diseases, access to improved sources of water can result in better health, and therefore better school attendance, with positive longer-term consequences for their lives.</li><br>
      <li>Inadequate management of urban, industrial and agricultural wastewater means the drinking-water of hundreds of millions of people is dangerously contaminated or chemically polluted. Natural presence of chemicals, particularly in groundwater,
        can also be of health significance, including arsenic and fluoride, while other chemicals, such as lead, may be elevated in drinking-water as a result of leaching from water supply components in contact with drinking-water.</li>

    <br>
    <li>Electricity problem</li><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Electricity is mainly used in households to power appliances including refrigerators and cooling systems, lighting systems, heating and cooking appliances, and television and ICT devices .These offer important services to support food preparation and preservation, home-based production and academic activities, safety and security, communication and access to information, as well as air conditioning, comfort, and leisure .In some cases, especially in developed countries, electricity is also used to support homebased medical care and operate lifts to ease movement. </li><br>
      <li>Therefore, the impacts that result from loss of electricity supply can differ for individual households depending on their electricity needs (uses), capacities, and preferences . Higher electricity-consuming households are most likely to suffer greater impacts and costs from power outages than lower electricity-consuming household.Households that use electricity for critical and specialized purposes, such as powering medical devices used for providing home-based healthcare services, may suffer an even greater outage impact </li>

    <li>Pest control</li>
    <ul>
      <p>Vector-Borne Diseases - Infectious diseases such as Zika virus, Lyme disease, and rabies can be carried and spread by vectors. Disease vectors include mosquitoes, ticks, and rodents and other animals. EPA registers several pesticide products, including repellents, that may be used to control these vectors or pests:</p>
       <li>Mosquitoes</li>
       <li>Rodents and rodenticides</li>
       <li>Insect repellents</li>
       <p>Asthma and Allergies - Indoor household pests such as cockroaches can trigger asthma and allergy symptoms. You can use EPA-registered products to control these pests. EPA also provides information to the public about properly using these products in homes and schools. Read more about: </p>

        <p>Microbial Diseases and Infections -  Various microorganisms and acellular particles, including bacteria, viruses, prions and protozoans, cause microbial diseases and infections in people. Many institutions, such as hospitals, health clinics, and food-processing facilities, use EPA-registered antimicrobial pesticides to control these organisms and prevent the spread of diseases.
